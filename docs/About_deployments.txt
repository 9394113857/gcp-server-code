After making the necessary additions, setting up logs, and making changes from the Git clone to my PythonAnywhere account, everything is finally up and running. The frontend Angular code on Netlify is successfully connected to the backend Flask code on PythonAnywhere. Both the frontend and backend are operational as of 16-07-24. The changes were pushed to live from the office system, and both codes are now functioning correctly.
