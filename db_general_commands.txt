# Initialize the migrations directory:
# This command creates a 'migrations' directory in your project.
# The 'migrations' directory is where Alembic (the database migration tool) will store migration scripts.
# You only need to run this command once when you first set up migrations for your project.
flask db init

# Generate an initial migration script:
# This command compares your database schema with your SQLAlchemy models.
# It creates a new migration script that captures the changes needed to bring the database schema in line with your models.
# For example, if you have added new models or fields, this command will generate a script to create those tables and columns.
flask db migrate

# Apply the migration to the database:
# This command runs the migration script generated by 'flask db migrate'.
# It updates the database schema to match the changes described in the migration script.
# This might include creating new tables, adding or removing columns, or altering existing tables.
flask db upgrade
